## üöß Areas Where Help Is Needed

We‚Äôre currently looking for contributors to help with:

- **Modularizing the codebase**: Breaking down the monolithic script (`ytconverter.py`) into smaller, manageable modules.
- **Improving testability**: Making the code easier to test, possibly by refactoring away from `input()` toward CLI arguments or config-driven options.
- **Modernizing dependencies**: Replacing older libraries like [`requests`](https://pypi.org/project/requests/), [`colored`](https://pypi.org/project/colored/), and [`fontstyle`](https://pypi.org/project/fontstyle/) with more modern and performant alternatives such as [`httpx`](https://pypi.org/project/httpx/) and [`rich`](https://pypi.org/project/rich/).

- **Building a Web GUI (Frontend Help Wanted)**:

We‚Äôre excited to welcome contributors who want to build a clean, user-friendly web interface for **YTConverter‚Ñ¢**. This is your chance to design the experience ‚Äî feel free to implement your own ideas and UI logic!

To get you started, here‚Äôs a very rough sketch of how the backend might work, but you‚Äôre absolutely encouraged to adapt or redesign it however you see fit:

- A typical flow could include:
  - Input for video URL
  - Options for format selection (e.g., MP3, MP4)
  - Quality preferences (high, medium, low, etc.)
  - Display of download progress and status
  - Download button when ready

- On the backend side, there might be endpoints like:
  - `POST /api/download` to start the process
  - `GET /api/status/{task_id}` to check progress

But feel free to suggest improvements or create alternative approaches that best fit your frontend design.

Your creativity and expertise are what will truly make the app shine ‚Äî so no pressure to strictly follow the current backend. We‚Äôre here to support you in integrating your frontend with the backend smoothly.

Thank you in advance for helping make **YTConverter‚Ñ¢** more accessible and enjoyable for everyone!
